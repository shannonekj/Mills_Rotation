Hsap_contam_metasim_db
	This directory contains information regarding simulated metagenomes.
	The metagenomes were constructed during Shannon Joslin's rotation February-March 2017
	These metagenomes were contructed in order to evaluate Deconseq and BMTagger.
	Metagenomes were constructed using MetaSim.

Simulated metagenomes were created from the following profiles:

<abundance_profile>
taxon abundance profiles
location: /group/kmkalangrp/SEKJ_work/metasim_profiles/simulation_profiles
highH_highB_totAbund.mprf
highH_lowB_totAbund.mprf
lowH_highB_totAbund.mprf
lowH_lowB_totAbund.mprf
	Four metagenomes were created with different human and B.infantis profiles
